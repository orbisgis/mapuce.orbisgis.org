The mapuce.orbisgis.org is a web cartographic application dedicated to show the results of the Mapuce project. 
It's based on the [mviewer](https://github.com/geobretagne/mviewer) application developed by the GÃ©oBretagne community.

MApUCE project has been originally developed within the [MApUCE](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-13-VBDU-0004) research project, funded by [ANR](https://anr.fr).


**Due to OVH incident the mapuce.orbisgis.org is no longer available.**

Please go to [monitoring.orbigis.org](monitoring.orbigis.org) to view the data processed and published by the OrbisGIS team throughout their research projects. 


## Note that the GIS part of the MApUCE project moves forward with a new methodology and a new tool called [GeoClimate](https://github.com/orbisgis/geoclimate)
